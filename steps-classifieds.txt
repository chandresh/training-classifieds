## Debug

1. Use puts

2. Use pry-rails

add to Gemfile
put "binding.pry" wherever you want to explore the running code.

Ctr-D to get out of pry and move to next binding.pry or normal.

## Gemfile groups

group :development do
  gem 'pry-rails'

#### Homework: ####  11 June 2013

1. Practice the stuff we discussed.

8. Create a my account section for the users. The users can edit/view their account & only their account details.

9. Admin related stuff: admin login.

10. Admin can manage users, can view/edit the details of any users.

11. Admin category management.

12. Members can post an adverts or see their past adverts

13. Admin approves the advert

14. Work on displaying the adverts

15. Contact form for the adverts

#### Scaffold ####

Use scaffold, but

1. Delete extra actions.

2. Disable extra routes. -> 404 error. 

resources :users, only: [:show, :new]

3. Use before_filters to protect member or admin only stuff

4. MOST IMPORTANT: Always access stuff from current_user (or similar) for the logged in users.

@advert = Advert.new XXX Totally wrong
@advert = current_user.adverts.new ## PERFECT!
