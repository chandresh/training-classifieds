Homework
Try https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave

#### Scaffold ####

If you do any typo:

--------------------------
If the migration is already run:

rake db:rollback
--------------------------

rails destroy scaffold Advert


### Use scaffold, but ###

1. Delete extra actions.

2. Disable extra routes. -> 404 error. 

resources :users, only: [:show, :new]

3. Use before_filters to protect member or admin only stuff

4. MOST IMPORTANT: Always access stuff from current_user (or similar) for the logged in users.

@advert = Advert.new XXX Totally wrong
@advert = current_user.adverts.new ## PERFECT!

5. Delete views that you don't require.

6. SUPER IMPORTANT: check attr_accessible list
